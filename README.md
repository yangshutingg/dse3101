# Benchmarking Economic Models with Shiny

## Introduction
This Shiny application is designed for benchmarking different economic forecasting models. Users can select start and end quarters, set forecast horizons, and choose between various economic model types such as AR, ADL, and more. The application then visualizes the forecasted economic indicators and compares the performance of the selected models.

## Installation

Before running the application, ensure you have R installed on your system. The application requires several R packages which can be installed with the following commands:

```R
install.packages(c("readxl", "tidyverse", "zoo", "sandwich", "lsei", "shiny", "shinyWidgets", "shinythemes"))
